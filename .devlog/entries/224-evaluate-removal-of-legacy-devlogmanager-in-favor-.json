      "content": "**USER FEEDBACK**: Agreed to remove legacy /api/devlogs endpoints entirely rather than just deprecating. Will implement comprehensive cleanup:\n\n1. Remove legacy API routes (/api/devlogs/*)\n2. Remove DevlogManager tests \n3. Update documentation to only show WorkspaceDevlogManager\n4. Clean up exports and imports\n\nThis aligns with the project's \"quality over continuity\" philosophy - removing legacy code for cleaner architecture."
