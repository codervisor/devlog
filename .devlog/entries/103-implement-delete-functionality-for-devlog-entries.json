      "category": "solution",
      "content": "Changed approach: Instead of implementing delete functionality, we should use the existing complete_devlog function to close test entries. This aligns with GitHub Issues behavior (no delete, only close) and maintains consistency across storage backends. Test entries should be marked as 'done' or 'closed' status rather than deleted."
