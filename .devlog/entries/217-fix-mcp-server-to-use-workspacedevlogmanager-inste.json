  "title": "Fix MCP Server to Use WorkspaceDevlogManager Instead of DevlogManager",
  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The MCP server is currently using the old DevlogManager class instead of the new WorkspaceDevlogManager, which prevents it from accessing GitHub-stored devlogs when the workspace is switched to 'devlog-github'. This causes the server to always return local JSON devlogs regardless of workspace selection.\n\n**Current Problem:**\n- Workspace config shows 'devlog-github' as active workspace using GitHub storage\n- MCP server still initializes with DevlogManager (single storage) instead of WorkspaceDevlogManager (workspace-aware)\n- Result: devlog commands always return local JSON entries instead of GitHub Issues\n\n**Root Cause:**\nMCPDevlogAdapter uses `new DevlogManager()` instead of `new WorkspaceDevlogManager()` in its constructor and initialize method.",

Modified MCP server to respect workspace configuration from ~/.devlog/workspaces.json\n3. Changed default workspace from 'default' (local JSON) to 'devlog-github' (GitHub storage)\n\n**Test Results:**\n- Before fix: MCP tools returned local JSON devlogs (IDs 162, 107, etc.)\n- After fix: MCP tools return GitHub Issues (IDs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 20)\n- ✅ `mcp_devlog_list_devlogs` now shows GitHub-stored devlogs\n- ✅ `mcp_devlog_create_devlog` creates GitHub Issues\n\nThe MCP server now correctly respects workspace switching!"

When users switch workspace from 'default' to 'devlog-github', the MCP server now correctly returns GitHub Issues instead of local JSON devlogs."
