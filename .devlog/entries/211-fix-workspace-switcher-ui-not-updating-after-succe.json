  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "After successfully switching workspaces via PUT /api/workspaces/{id}/switch (which returns 200 OK), the workspace switcher UI still displays the original workspace name instead of updating to show the newly selected workspace. The API call works correctly but the frontend UI does not reflect the workspace change.",

The setCurrentWorkspace(data.workspace) on line 166 updates local state, but the immediate page reload prevents React from re-rendering with the new state. This causes the UI to show stale workspace info after reload."

When switching workspaces from the workspaces page, only the local WorkspaceSwitcher state updates, but the sidebar WorkspaceSwitcher isn't notified. The sidebar component needs to listen for workspace changes or use a shared state management system. The window.location.reload() was a workaround to force both components to re-fetch, but caused timing issues."

The sidebar WorkspaceSwitcher now immediately reflects the current workspace after switching."
