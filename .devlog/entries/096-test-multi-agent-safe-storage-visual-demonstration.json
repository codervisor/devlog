  "description": "This is a test devlog entry created to demonstrate the new conflict-free timestamp-based ID generation system. This entry should receive a timestamp-based ID instead of a sequential one, proving that multiple AI agents can now work simultaneously without merge conflicts.\n\nThe new system:\n- Uses timestamp + random suffix for unique IDs\n- Eliminates race conditions in index.json\n- Allows concurrent devlog creation\n- Maintains backward compatibility",
