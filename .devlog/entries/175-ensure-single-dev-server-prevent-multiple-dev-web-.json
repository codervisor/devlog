      "content": "**SIMPLE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED ✅**\n\n**Approach: Force Single Port + Clear Feedback**\n1. **Fixed port**: Modified `packages/web/package.json` to use `next dev --port 3000` (no auto-port-finding)\n2. **Port check script**: Added simple `scripts/dev-with-check.sh` that shows current port usage\n3. **Clear failure**: When port is in use, Next.js gives clear EADDRINUSE error\n\n**User Experience:**\n- ✅ Shows existing servers: \"📡 Port 3000 is in use: http://localhost:3000\"  \n- ✅ Clear failure message when trying to start duplicate\n- ✅ Preserves hot reload on existing server\n- ✅ No complex detection logic - leverages Next.js built-in error handling\n\n**Result:** Simple, reliable, and user-friendly. AI agents and developers get clear feedback about existing servers."
