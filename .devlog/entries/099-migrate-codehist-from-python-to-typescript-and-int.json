The combined system could provide insights into AI agent effectiveness, conversation patterns, and development workflows that inform better project management decisions.",
    "technicalContext": "The current codehist implementation is written in Python with dependencies on typer, rich, pydantic, and various data processing libraries. It discovers VS Code's chat session storage files across platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux) and parses JSON data into structured models. The migration requires converting Python classes to TypeScript interfaces/types, replacing Python-specific libraries with Node.js equivalents, and adapting file system operations for cross-platform compatibility.",
