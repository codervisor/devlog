  "description": "The timeseries calculation incorrectly applies date range filters to cumulative totals (totalCreated/totalClosed). These should be all-time cumulative counts up to each date, while only daily activity metrics should be filtered by the query date range.",

Root cause was that getTimeSeriesStats was using the paginated list() method which only returned 100 entries instead of all entries. Also fixed timezone handling by using end-of-day timestamps for accurate date comparisons. The totalCreated on the last day now correctly matches the overview stats total (155), confirming accurate cumulative calculation across all time periods."
