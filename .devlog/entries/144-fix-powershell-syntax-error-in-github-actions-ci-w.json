  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The GitHub Actions CI workflow has a PowerShell syntax error when running on Windows platform. The error \"Missing condition in if statement after 'if ('.\" occurs because the PowerShell variable $LASTEXITCODE is not properly escaped in the YAML workflow file, causing the parser to interpret it incorrectly.",

The solution uses -PassThru parameter to capture the process and wraps the command in a try-catch to handle any errors gracefully. This avoids the shell escaping issues with the $LASTEXITCODE variable in YAML.",
