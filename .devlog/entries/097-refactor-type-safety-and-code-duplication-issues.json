    "businessContext": "This refactoring directly impacts developer productivity and code maintainability. The current type safety issues make the codebase harder to work with, increase the likelihood of runtime errors, and reduce IDE support effectiveness. Eliminating code duplication reduces maintenance burden and ensures consistency across the application.",
    "technicalContext": "Analysis revealed several critical areas: 1) MCP adapter extensively uses 'any' types (20+ instances), reducing type safety; 2) GitHub type mapping logic is duplicated between github-storage.ts and github-mapper.ts with identical switch statements; 3) Error handling patterns are inconsistent across packages; 4) Missing proper TypeScript interfaces for tool arguments and return types.",
