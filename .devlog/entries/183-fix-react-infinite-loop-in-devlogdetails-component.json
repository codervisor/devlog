The error is caused by a useEffect in DevlogDetails component that has handleSave and handleDiscard as dependencies, which are recreated on every render, causing the effect to run repeatedly and trigger state updates in parent components.",

      "content": "🔧 **Root Cause Identified and Fixed**\n\n**Problem**: The infinite loop was caused by a useEffect dependency issue in DevlogDetails.tsx on lines 310-315. The effect included `handleSave` and `handleDiscard` in its dependencies array, but these functions were being recreated on every render due to lack of proper memoization.\n\n**Solution Applied**: Removed `handleSave` and `handleDiscard` from the useEffect dependencies array. These function references don't need to trigger the effect when they change - the effect should only run when the state values (`hasUnsavedChanges`, `isSaving`, `saveError`) or the callback (`onUnsavedChangesChange`) change.\n\n**Technical Details**:\n- Changed: `}, [hasUnsavedChanges, isSaving, saveError, onUnsavedChangesChange, handleSave, handleDiscard]);`  \n- To: `}, [hasUnsavedChanges, isSaving, saveError, onUnsavedChangesChange]);`\n\nThis prevents the infinite cycle: useEffect runs → calls onUnsavedChangesChange → parent updates → re-render → functions recreated → useEffect runs again.",

The real issue is in **Ant Design's Typography component** with ellipsis measurement.\n\n**Error Details:**\n- Error: \"Maximum update depth exceeded\" \n- Stack trace points to: `antd/es/typography/Base/Ellipsis.js:110:13`\n- The component `EllipsisMeasure` is causing setState loops in useLayoutEffect\n- Specifically affecting devlogs with empty notes (like devlog 182)\n\n**The Previous Fix Was Incomplete:**\n- Removing handleSave/handleDiscard from useEffect dependencies wasn't the actual cause\n- The real infinite loop is coming from Ant Design's Text component ellipsis functionality\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Need to identify which Text component is causing the ellipsis measurement loop\n2. Likely related to empty content or specific conditions that trigger measurement issues"

      "content": "✅ **Root Cause Found and Fixed!**\n\nThe issue was indeed related to empty notes, but not in the Typography components. The problem was in the **note animation tracking useEffect**.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The useEffect for tracking new notes had `devlog.notes` and `seenNoteIds` as dependencies\n- When `devlog.notes` is an empty array `[]`, the array reference changes on each render\n- This caused the useEffect to run repeatedly, even though the array was always empty\n- `seenNoteIds` being in the dependency array also contributed to the loop\n\n**Fix Applied:**\n1. Changed the early return condition to check both null and empty: `if (!devlog.notes || devlog.notes.length === 0)`\n2. Added proper handling for empty notes case - reset seenNoteIds if needed\n3. **Removed `seenNoteIds` from dependency array** to prevent dependency loops\n4. Changed dependencies to `[devlog.notes?.length, devlog.id]` - more stable references\n\n**Verification:**\n- Tested devlog 182 (which has empty notes: `\"notes\":[]`)  \n- Page loads successfully without infinite loop errors\n- Only minor warnings remain (font loading, Timeline deprecation)\n- No more \"Maximum update depth exceeded\" errors",
