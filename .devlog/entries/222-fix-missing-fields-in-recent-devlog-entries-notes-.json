  "title": "Fix: Missing fields in recent devlog entries (notes, contexts, etc.)",
  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Recent devlog entries are missing important fields like notes, contexts, and other data fields. This may be related to recent MCP changes or storage/serialization issues. Need to investigate data persistence, field mapping, and potential breaking changes in the MCP layer.",
  "priority": "high",
  "technicalContext": "Issue affects data integrity and persistence in the devlog system. Recent MCP changes (#220, #218, #219) modified workspace handling and API endpoints. Need to verify if field mapping or serialization was affected.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "All expected fields (notes, contexts, business context, technical context, etc.) are properly saved and retrieved",
    "No data loss in existing entries",
    "New entries include all expected fields",
    "Field serialization/deserialization works correctly"
