  "type": "refactor",
  "description": "Refactor the current GitHub storage implementation from being a primary storage provider to an external integration/sync system. Currently, GitHub storage is treated as one of the storage options alongside JSON, SQLite, and PostgreSQL, which creates confusion about the system architecture.\n\n**Current Issues:**\n- GitHub storage is listed as a primary storage type in DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE\n- Creates confusion about where data is actually stored\n- Mixes data persistence concerns with external system integration\n- Makes it unclear what the \"source of truth\" is for devlog data\n\n**Proposed Architecture:**\n- Primary storage: SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production)\n- External integrations: GitHub Issues sync, Jira sync, etc.\n- GitHub integration syncs data bidirectionally with primary database\n- Clear separation of concerns between storage and integration\n\nThis aligns with the broader goal of simplifying storage options and creating a cleaner architecture.",
