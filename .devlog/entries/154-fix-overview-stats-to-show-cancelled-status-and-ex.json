  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The overview stats currently show \"Cancelled\" status as always 0 because cancelled entries are being excluded by the default filter logic. Instead of excluding cancelled entries, we should exclude archived entries from stats calculation while maintaining all status counts including cancelled.",

Changed from applying status filters (which excluded cancelled) to applying explicit archived=false filter.\n\n✅ **Testing Verified**: Added comprehensive tests covering:\n- Cancelled entries are now included in stats \n- Archived entries are excluded from stats\n- All other behavior remains unchanged\n- All existing tests still pass (68/68)\n\n✅ **Build Status**: Core and MCP packages build successfully. Ready to test web UI changes.",

      "content": "✅ **Improved Solution Using Common Filter Helper**\n\nYou were absolutely right about using `applyDefaultFilters` as the common filter helper! The previous implementation was inconsistent and had incorrect \"backward compatibility\" logic.\n\n**Key Changes Made:**\n- **Enhanced `applyDefaultFilters()`**: Added `options: { includeAllStatuses?: boolean }` parameter  \n- **Removed Incorrect Logic**: Eliminated confusing \"backward compatibility\" comment about including 'done' status\n- **Consistent Behavior**: Now `getStats()` uses `applyDefaultFilters({}, { includeAllStatuses: true })` \n- **Proper Logic**: Default list behavior should exclude ALL closed entries (both done AND cancelled), not just cancelled\n\n**Current Behavior (Correct):**\n- **Stats**: Include all statuses (open + closed), exclude archived ✅\n- **Lists**: Include only open statuses by default, exclude archived ✅  \n- **Explicit Filtering**: Users can request specific statuses including closed ones ✅\n\n**API Verification:**\n- Total: 143 entries (includes cancelled correctly)\n- Cancelled: 16 entries (now showing properly instead of 0)\n- All tests passing ✅\n\nThis is a much cleaner architectural solution that maintains consistency across the codebase!",
