  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Add batch operation capabilities to the devlog system, allowing users to perform operations on multiple devlog entries simultaneously. This includes batch status updates, priority changes, type changes, bulk deletion, bulk assignment, and bulk note addition. The feature should provide both UI components for selection and core API support for batch operations.",

    "businessContext": "Batch operations significantly improve productivity when managing large numbers of devlog entries. Users frequently need to perform the same operation on multiple items (e.g., marking multiple tasks as \"done\" after a sprint, changing priority of related items, or bulk assigning work). Without batch operations, users must perform these actions one by one, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This feature addresses a common workflow inefficiency and improves user experience.",
    "technicalContext": "The implementation requires extending both the core DevlogManager class and the web UI components. Core changes include new batch operation methods in DevlogManager, extended API endpoints for batch operations, and appropriate error handling for partial failures. UI changes include selection checkboxes in the DevlogList component, a batch actions toolbar, and confirmation dialogs for destructive operations. The implementation should maintain data consistency and provide clear feedback on operation results.",
