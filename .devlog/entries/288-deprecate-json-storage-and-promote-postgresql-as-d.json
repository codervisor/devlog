  "description": "Officially deprecate JSON storage as the recommended storage option for the devlog system. This involves:\n\n1. Adding deprecation warnings to JSON storage provider\n2. Updating documentation to recommend PostgreSQL\n3. Adding migration guidance for existing users\n4. Setting PostgreSQL as default for new installations\n5. Planning timeline for eventual removal\n6. Communicating changes to users and contributors\n\nThe deprecation should be graceful - existing JSON installations should continue to work with clear guidance on how to migrate, but new installations should use PostgreSQL by default.",

Add runtime warnings when JSON storage is used\n3. Update configuration templates and documentation\n4. Provide clear upgrade instructions\n5. Keep PostgreSQL as option for production/multi-user deployments",
