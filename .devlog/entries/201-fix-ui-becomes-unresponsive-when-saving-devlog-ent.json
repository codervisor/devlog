  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The user interface becomes unresponsive or non-interactive when saving a devlog entry in the devlog details page. This creates a poor user experience as users cannot tell if the save operation is in progress, has completed, or has failed. The UI should provide feedback during save operations and remain responsive.",

      "content": "Successfully reproduced the save functionality on devlog details page. Found that save operations do work and complete successfully with SSE events, but there are UX issues: 1) No loading indicator during save operation, 2) Save button doesn't get disabled during save (remains clickable), 3) No visual feedback to show save is in progress. The \"unresponsiveness\" might be more about poor UX feedback rather than actual blocking. Need to examine the save component code to implement proper loading states."

      "content": "Confirmed the exact issue with save loading states. The Save Changes button shows [active] state but is not properly disabled or showing loading spinner during save operation. The issue is that the DevlogDetails component manages its own isSaving state but this doesn't properly propagate to disable buttons in DevlogDetailsPage. The button state synchronization between parent and child components is incomplete. Need to implement proper loading state propagation to ensure buttons are disabled and show loading indicators during save operations."

      "category": "solution",
      "content": "FIXED! The root cause was duplicate isSaving states in both DevlogDetailsPage and DevlogDetails components. The solution was to remove the child's isSaving state and have the parent manage the single source of truth. Now the parent sets isSaving(true) before calling updateDevlog() and isSaving(false) when complete, properly controlling the Save button's loading state. The build completed successfully and the architecture is much cleaner with no state synchronization issues."

      "content": "Completed: Successfully fixed UI responsiveness issue during save operations. Root cause was duplicate isSaving states between parent and child components causing synchronization issues. Implemented clean architecture with single source of truth: parent (DevlogDetailsPage) manages business logic state (isSaving, hasUnsavedChanges, saveError) while child (DevlogDetails) manages only UI/form state (localChanges, originalDevlog, animations). Save buttons now properly show loading indicators and get disabled during save operations. All acceptance criteria have been met."
