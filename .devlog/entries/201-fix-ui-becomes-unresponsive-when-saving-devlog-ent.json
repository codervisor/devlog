  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The user interface becomes unresponsive or non-interactive when saving a devlog entry in the devlog details page. This creates a poor user experience as users cannot tell if the save operation is in progress, has completed, or has failed. The UI should provide feedback during save operations and remain responsive.",
