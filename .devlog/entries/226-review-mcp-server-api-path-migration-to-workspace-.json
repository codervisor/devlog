  "type": "task",
  "description": "User requested to replace all API paths with workspace-aware versions in the MCP tools. Upon investigation, the MCP server doesn't use HTTP API endpoints - it's a Model Context Protocol server that communicates via stdio and directly uses WorkspaceDevlogManager from the core package. Need to clarify what specific API paths need updating or if the user meant something else.",
