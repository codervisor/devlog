  "description": "Create a migration strategy and tooling to move all existing JSON devlog entries to PostgreSQL database. This includes:\n\n1. Data migration script that reads from JSON files\n2. Validation to ensure data integrity during migration  \n3. Handling of edge cases and malformed data\n4. Rollback procedure in case of issues\n5. Update configuration to default to PostgreSQL\n6. Deprecation notices for JSON storage\n\nThe migration must preserve all existing data including:\n- All devlog entries with their complete history\n- Notes and timestamps\n- AI context and decisions\n- External references and relationships\n- Chat history and links (if applicable)",
