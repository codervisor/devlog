  "title": "Fix realtime update issue: MCP updates don't trigger web UI refreshes",
  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The web UI has Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation for realtime updates, but when MCP tools update devlogs, the web UI doesn't update in realtime. This is because MCP adapter directly uses DevlogManager while the web API routes use broadcastUpdate() to notify SSE clients. Need to integrate SSE broadcasting into MCP operations.",

    "technicalContext": "Current architecture: Web API routes call broadcastUpdate() → SSE clients get updates. But MCP adapter bypasses web API and directly calls DevlogManager, so no SSE broadcasts happen. Need to either: 1) Make MCP call web API, 2) Add SSE broadcasting to DevlogManager, or 3) Create shared event system.",
