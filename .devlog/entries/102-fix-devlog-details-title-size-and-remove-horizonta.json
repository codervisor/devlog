      "content": "Successfully fixed the devlog details title issues. Changes made:\n\n1. **Title Level**: Changed from `level={2}` to `level={3}` to maintain proper hierarchy (section headings are level 3)\n2. **Font Size**: Set explicit font-size of 24px (down from ~32px) to be appropriately sized but still larger than section headings\n3. **Horizontal Scrollbar**: Removed `thin-scrollbar-horizontal` class and `overflow-x: auto` to eliminate poor scrolling UX\n4. **Text Wrapping**: Added `word-wrap: break-word`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, and cross-browser `hyphens` support\n5. **Responsive Layout**: Changed from fixed height to `min-height` and proper flexbox alignment\n6. **Header Optimization**: Reduced header height from 102px to 96px and updated sticky offsets accordingly\n\nTesting shows the title now wraps properly at smaller screen sizes without horizontal scrolling, maintains visual hierarchy, and provides a much better user experience.",
