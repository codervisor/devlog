The configuration manager in the core package and MCP server index.ts both access process.env variables but don't import/configure dotenv to load the .env file.",

      "content": "Successfully fixed the .env file loading issue. The problem was that both packages were using `import dotenv from 'dotenv'` (default import) instead of `import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'` (namespace import) which is required for ESM modules.\n\nAfter applying the fix:\n- Both packages build successfully\n- MCP server starts properly with message \"Devlog MCP Server started with flexible storage architecture\"\n- Server responds correctly to tools/list requests showing all tools are loaded\n- Environment variables from .env file are now properly accessible to ConfigurationManager\n\nThe fix ensures that:\n- DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE=postgres is loaded correctly\n- POSTGRES_URL database connection string is available\n- NODE_ENV and other configuration variables are accessible",
