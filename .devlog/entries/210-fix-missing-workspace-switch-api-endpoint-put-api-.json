  "description": "The workspace switching functionality is attempting to call PUT /api/workspaces/devlog-github/switch but this API endpoint doesn't exist, resulting in 404 errors. This breaks the workspace switching feature in the web UI.\n\nError: PUT /api/workspaces/devlog-github/switch 404 in 296ms\n\nNeed to investigate where this API call is made from and implement the missing endpoint.",
