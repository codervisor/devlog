  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Design and implement a comprehensive AI agent orchestration platform that moves beyond simple code completion to managing autonomous AI agents (like GitHub Copilot's agent mode) working collaboratively on complex development tasks. This includes Docker-based agent isolation, workflow supervision, real-time observability through chat history parsing, and data-driven prompt optimization.",

      "content": "**Initial Architecture Analysis**: \n\nThe AI agent orchestration platform needs to handle several key architectural challenges:\n\n**1. Agent Isolation & Resource Management**\n- Docker containers for each agent with configurable CPU/memory limits\n- Network isolation with controlled inter-agent communication channels\n- Filesystem isolation with shared volumes only for collaboration points\n- Process monitoring to detect runaway agents or resource abuse\n\n**2. Workflow Definition & Execution**\n- YAML/JSON workflow definitions similar to GitHub Actions\n- Support for conditional logic, loops, and error handling\n- Agent role assignment (architect, implementer, tester, reviewer)\n- Checkpoint/resume capability for long-running workflows\n\n**3. Human Supervision Framework**\n- Approval gates for different risk levels (file creation, API calls, deployments)\n- Real-time intervention capabilities to pause/redirect agents\n- Escalation policies for stuck or conflicting agents\n- Audit trail of all human decisions and agent actions\n\n**4. Observability & Optimization**\n- Real-time chat history capture from all active agents\n- Performance metrics (task completion time, error rates, human intervention frequency)\n- Pattern analysis for prompt optimization opportunities\n- Dashboard for monitoring multiple concurrent workflows\n\nThis builds directly on the Docker foundation from devlog 260 but scales it to enterprise-level agent management."

    "businessContext": "The AI coding landscape has fundamentally shifted from simple autocomplete tools to autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-step development workflows. GitHub Copilot's agent mode, Cursor's agent capabilities, and similar tools can now write entire features, debug complex issues, and coordinate across multiple files autonomously. This evolution requires moving from reactive chat history analysis to proactive agent orchestration and workflow management. Organizations need platforms to manage, monitor, and optimize these autonomous agents while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions.",
    "technicalContext": "Building on the Docker foundation from devlog 260, this platform will implement: 1) Agent lifecycle management with container-based isolation, 2) Workflow orchestration for multi-step autonomous tasks, 3) Real-time chat history capture as the observability backbone, 4) Prompt optimization pipelines using historical performance data, 5) Human-in-the-loop supervision with configurable approval gates, 6) Multi-agent coordination protocols for collaborative development, and 7) Resource management for scalable agent deployment. The architecture will extend @devlog/ai's existing parser infrastructure to support real-time agent monitoring and coordination.",
