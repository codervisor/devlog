  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "When using MCP tools to perform devlog operations (create, update, delete), the web frontend doesn't receive realtime updates via SSE. The issue appears to be in the connection between MCP server and web server for event broadcasting. Users need to manually refresh to see changes made through MCP tools.",

      "content": "🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: MCP and Web processes are separate Node.js processes with isolated memory spaces. Even with singleton pattern, they each have their own DevlogEventEmitter instance. The SSE bridge listens to the Web process's DevlogEventEmitter, but MCP operations emit to the MCP process's DevlogEventEmitter.\n\n**Evidence from related devlogs:**\n- Devlog #146: Documents the original file-based cross-process communication system\n- Devlog #147: Refactored to storage-agnostic event system but removed cross-process communication \n- Devlog #229: Confirms SSE singleton fix alone is insufficient due to process separation\n\n**Current Architecture Problem:**\n```\n┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐\n│   MCP Server    │    │   Web Server    │\n│   (VS Code)     │    │   (Next.js)     │\n│                 │    │                 │\n│ DevlogManager   │    │ DevlogManager   │\n│ ├─EventEmitter  │    │ ├─EventEmitter  │\n│ └─Emits events  │    │ └─SSE Bridge    │\n│   (ISOLATED)    │    │   listens here  │\n└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Solution needed:** Restore cross-process communication via storage-based event detection."

      "content": "✅ **SOLUTION IDENTIFIED**: Need to implement storage subscription in WorkspaceDevlogManager to restore cross-process communication. The JSON storage provider already has the subscription mechanism from devlog #147, but WorkspaceDevlogManager is not subscribing to storage events.\n\n**Required implementation:**\n1. Add storage subscription setup in WorkspaceDevlogManager.initialize()\n2. Subscribe to storage events and forward them to local DevlogEventEmitter\n3. Handle workspace switching to maintain proper subscriptions\n4. Ensure cleanup on manager disposal\n\nThis will restore the architecture where:\n```\nMCP Process → Storage Changes → Web Process (via storage subscription) → SSE Bridge → Frontend\n```"

Added `storageSubscriptions` map to track unsubscribe functions per workspace\n2. Implemented `subscribeToStorageEvents()` method to set up storage watching\n3. Implemented `handleStorageEvent()` method to forward storage events to DevlogEventEmitter\n4. Updated `switchToWorkspace()` to subscribe to new workspace events\n5. Updated `initializeFallbackMode()` to subscribe to fallback storage events  \n6. Updated `deleteWorkspace()` and `cleanup()` to properly unsubscribe from events\n\n**Architecture restored:**\n```\nMCP Process → JSON File Changes → Web Process (via fs.watch) → SSE Bridge → Frontend\n```\n\n**Build status:** ✅ Core and Web packages build successfully\n**Next:** Test the real-time updates with MCP operations"

Frontend testing needed to confirm SSE events are received."

However, there seems to be a disconnect between MCP server operations and web server event broadcasting, potentially due to separate DevlogManager instances or event emitter singletons not being properly shared.",
