  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The MCP integration tests are failing because the findProjectRoot function can't find project indicators in temporary test directories. The function throws \"Unable to find project root for /tmp/mcp-integration-test-workspace\" errors during test initialization. Need to fix the storage utility to handle test environments properly and update test setup to follow best practices.",

      "content": "Completed: Successfully fixed all MCP integration test failures. The main issues were: 1) Project root detection failing in temporary test directories - fixed by creating package.json in test workspace, 2) Test assertion expecting array instead of PaginatedResult - fixed by checking result.items property. All tests now pass consistently with proper test environment setup following the test instructions guidelines."
