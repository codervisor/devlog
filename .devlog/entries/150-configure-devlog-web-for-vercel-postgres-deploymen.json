Key changes:\n1. ✅ Created vercel.json with Next.js deployment config  \n2. ✅ Added .env.example with Vercel Postgres environment variables\n3. ✅ Added pg and @types/pg dependencies to package.json\n4. ✅ Created devlog.config.json for PostgreSQL with ${POSTGRES_URL} environment variable\n5. ✅ Kept devlog-manager.ts simple - it automatically uses the config file\n\nThe core package already supports PostgreSQL storage provider, so we don't need custom storage configuration logic. The ConfigurationManager will automatically load the devlog.config.json and expand environment variables."

      "category": "solution",
      "content": "✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Fixed Vercel deployment build script error. \n\nROOT CAUSE: The @devlog/ai package has a CLI binary (`./build/cli/index.js`) that doesn't exist until after build, but pnpm tries to create bin symlinks during install. This caused the original build command to fail.\n\nSOLUTION: Updated vercel.json buildCommand to build dependencies in correct order:\n1. `pnpm --filter @devlog/ai build` - builds AI package first\n2. `pnpm --filter @devlog/core build` - builds core (depends on AI)  \n3. `pnpm --filter @devlog/web build` - builds web (depends on core)\n\nThis ensures all workspace dependencies are properly built before the web package build runs."

Using `npm run build` in each package directory (changing working directory) works perfectly.\n\nTEST RESULTS:\n- ✅ AI package builds successfully (creates CLI binary)\n- ✅ Core package builds successfully (with AI dependency)  \n- ✅ Web package builds successfully (46-second Next.js build)\n- ✅ All 14 API routes and 4 pages compile correctly\n- ✅ No TypeScript errors\n- ✅ Build artifacts ready for deployment\n\nThe deployment should now work correctly on Vercel."
