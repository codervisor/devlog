  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Enhance the OverviewStats component to be collapsible, allowing users to toggle between a compact view and the full detailed view. This addresses the issue where the overview stats can become too long, especially on smaller screens or when displaying multiple status filters. The feature should maintain all existing functionality while providing better space management.",
