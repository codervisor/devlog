      "content": "✅ Successfully reorganized storage directory structure!\n\n**Changes implemented:**\n1. **Created provider-specific folders**: \n   - `storage/providers/` - Main storage implementations (github-storage.ts, json-storage.ts, typeorm-storage.ts)\n   - `storage/github/` - GitHub utilities (github-api.ts, github-labels.ts, github-mapper.ts, github-type-mapper.ts)\n   - `storage/typeorm/` - Database configs (typeorm-config.ts, chat-schema.ts)\n\n2. **Updated import paths**: All import statements throughout the codebase updated to use new structure\n3. **Created index.ts files**: Added proper exports for each module group\n4. **Removed duplicates**: Deleted original GitHub utility files from utils/ folder\n5. **Maintained API compatibility**: All public exports still work from core package\n\n**Verification:**\n- ✅ Core package builds successfully \n- ✅ All packages build without errors\n- ✅ TypeScript types resolve correctly\n- ✅ Import paths all working\n\nThe storage directory is now much better organized with logical groupings that make it easier to navigate and maintain.",

This refactoring will improve code maintainability, reduce cognitive load for developers, and create a more intuitive project structure.",
