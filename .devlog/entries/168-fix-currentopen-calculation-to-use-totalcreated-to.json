  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The currentOpen calculation incorrectly uses current status counts at historical dates, which doesn't account for status changes over time. It should be calculated as totalCreated - totalClosed to show the actual number of open entries at each point in time.",

The currentOpen calculation is now mathematically accurate and historically reliable."
