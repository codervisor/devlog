  "description": "The MCP devlog server is generating \"Failed to parse message\" warnings in VS Code output because console.log statements from the cross-process event system are being treated as JSON-RPC messages. The cross-process event system logs messages like \"Processed cross-process event: 1752681238879-37-created.json\" which are not valid JSON-RPC format.",
