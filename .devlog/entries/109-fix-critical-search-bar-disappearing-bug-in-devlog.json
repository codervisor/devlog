The dropdown is likely being closed when the state changes on input, causing the overlay to disappear.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. Examine the Ant Design Dropdown implementation\n2. Fix the state management to prevent dropdown from closing on input changes\n3. Test the fix with Playwright to ensure search remains open during typing"

      "content": "✅ **CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED** - Search functionality is now working correctly!\n\n**Root Cause Identified:**\n- Ant Design Dropdown component was closing on state changes due to uncontrolled open/close behavior\n- Filter state updates were causing component re-renders that closed the dropdown\n\n**Solution Implemented:**\n- Added controlled dropdown state using `useState` for `searchDropdownOpen`\n- Implemented separate local search value state (`localSearchValue`) \n- Only apply search filter on Enter key press or Search button click\n- Dropdown now stays open during typing and closes only when explicitly requested\n\n**Testing Results:**\n- ✅ Verified via Playwright browser testing\n- ✅ Search dropdown remains open when typing single and multiple characters\n- ✅ Users can now complete their search queries without interruption\n- ✅ Search functionality is fully operational",
