  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Recent changes have broken the SSE (Server-Sent Events) broadcast functionality, preventing realtime updates from reaching the frontend. Users are not receiving live updates for devlog changes, workspace switches, or other real-time events.",

      "content": "🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: WorkspaceDevlogManager is missing event emission after devlog operations. The SSE bridge depends on devlogEvents being emitted, but WorkspaceDevlogManager methods (createDevlog, updateDevlog, deleteDevlog, etc.) don't emit any events. This is why the frontend receives no realtime updates."

      "category": "progress",
      "content": "✅ **PARTIAL FIX IMPLEMENTED**: Added event emission to WorkspaceDevlogManager methods (createDevlog, updateDevlog, deleteDevlog, addNote). SSE connection works (confirmed via browser console), but events from web UI operations are not being received. This suggests the SSE bridge may not be connected to the same WorkspaceDevlogManager instance that handles web API calls."

Devlog #232 was successfully created through web UI, but SSE events are still not working. The event emission code is present in createDevlog method, but no SSE broadcasts are occurring. Need to debug event emission/handling next."

      "category": "issue",
      "content": "🎯 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Event emission code works correctly, but there are 0 event handlers when emitting! The issue is that multiple instances of devlogEvents are being created - SSE Bridge has 5 handlers initially, but WorkspaceDevlogManager sees 0 handlers. This suggests separate devlogEvents instances in different module contexts. Need to ensure single shared devlogEvents instance across API routes and SSE bridge."

      "content": "✅ **SSE ISSUE CONFIRMED via Web UI Test**: Created devlog \"Test SSE Events - Created via Web UI\" through web form. SSE connection works correctly (browser console shows \"SSE connected\" and connection messages), but NO devlog-created events are broadcast. This definitively confirms the root cause: multiple devlogEvents instances exist - SSE bridge listens to one, WorkspaceDevlogManager emits to another. Need to implement single shared devlogEvents instance across all contexts."

      "content": "🚫 **SINGLETON FIX ATTEMPTED BUT SSE STILL BROKEN**: Implemented singleton pattern for DevlogEventEmitter using getDevlogEvents() function, built core package successfully, but SSE events are still not working. Testing results:\n\n✅ SSE connection works (browser shows \"SSE connected\" messages)\n✅ Web UI devlog creation works (form submits successfully)\n✅ MCP devlog creation works (devlog #244 created)\n❌ NO SSE broadcast events received for either web UI or MCP-created devlogs\n❌ New devlogs don't appear in real-time (total still shows 229 instead of 244+)\n\nThe singleton pattern alone is insufficient. The issue may be deeper - potentially with Next.js module bundling/context separation, or the SSE endpoint itself not properly initializing the shared instance. Next steps: investigate Next.js SSE endpoint initialization and ensure singleton is being used consistently across all contexts."
