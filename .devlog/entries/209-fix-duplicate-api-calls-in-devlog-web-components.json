  "description": "Multiple React components in @devlog/web are making duplicate API calls, causing performance issues and unnecessary network requests. The main issue is that AppLayout, DashboardPage, and DevlogListPage all use both useDevlogs() and useStats() hooks, leading to redundant API calls to /api/devlogs and /api/devlogs/stats/overview on every page load.",

This means:\n\n✅ Our context-based solution DOES work for eliminating unnecessary duplicates\n✅ We successfully reduced from 4+ calls to 2 calls for devlogs API\n✅ We eliminated all stats API duplicates (from 2 to 1 call each)\n\n🎯 CONCLUSION: The remaining 2x calls for devlogs API are likely React Strict Mode behavior in development only, which is not a production issue that needs fixing.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Keep the current context-based solution as it provides significant performance improvements while preserving development debugging capabilities."
