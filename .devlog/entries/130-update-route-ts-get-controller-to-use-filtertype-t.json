  "description": "Update the GET controller in packages/web/app/api/devlogs/route.ts to use the filterType to status mapping utilities from @devlog/core. The current implementation has hardcoded status handling that should be replaced with the centralized filterTypeToStatusFilter utility function.\n\nCurrent issues:\n1. The route currently only handles 'status' query parameter as comma-separated values\n2. It doesn't support 'filterType' query parameter which should map to status arrays\n3. The mapping logic is not centralized and doesn't use the filter-mapping utilities\n\nThe update should:\n- Add support for 'filterType' query parameter (open, closed, total, individual statuses)\n- Use filterTypeToStatusFilter() from @devlog/core to convert filterType to status arrays\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing 'status' parameter\n- Prioritize filterType over status when both are provided",

Start with filterType to get base status array\n2. If status is also provided, intersect with the specified statuses\n3. If only status provided, use status directly (backward compatibility)\n4. If only filterType provided, use filterType mapping"
