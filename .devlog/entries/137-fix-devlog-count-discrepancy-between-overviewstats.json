  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "There's a discrepancy between the total count shown in OverviewStats (124) and DevlogList (111). Investigation shows that:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- OverviewStats gets data from `getStats()` which bypasses filtering and counts ALL devlogs including cancelled ones\n- DevlogList gets data from `listDevlogs()` which applies `applyDefaultFilters()` excluding cancelled entries but including done entries\n- The difference (13) likely represents cancelled devlogs\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nBoth components should show consistent counts. The OverviewStats should respect the same filtering logic as the list to maintain consistency in the UI.",
