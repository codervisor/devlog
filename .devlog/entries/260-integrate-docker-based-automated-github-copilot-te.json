    "businessContext": "The @devlog/ai package currently focuses on parsing historical chat data from AI assistants. Adding Docker-based automated Copilot testing would enable the package to actively generate and test code suggestions, expanding its capabilities from passive analysis to active AI interaction. This would be valuable for automated testing of AI-generated code quality, consistency testing across different prompts, and research into AI coding assistant behavior patterns.",
    "technicalContext": "The @devlog/ai package uses a modular architecture with parsers, models, and exporters. The Docker integration would add a new automation layer that can spin up containerized VS Code Insiders instances with GitHub Copilot, execute test scenarios, and capture the results. This would require extending the existing parser architecture to handle real-time data capture rather than just historical parsing, and adding Docker orchestration capabilities to the package.",
