      "content": "STRATEGIC EVOLUTION: This devlog has revealed a fundamental shift in scope. We've moved beyond simple Docker-based testing to recognizing that GitHub Copilot's agent mode represents a paradigm shift from code completion to autonomous coding agents. The @devlog/ai package should evolve into an AI agent orchestration platform with these key capabilities:\n\n1. **Agent Orchestration Layer**: Manage multiple autonomous AI agents working on different aspects of development tasks, with Docker providing isolation and resource management.\n\n2. **Workflow Supervision**: Implement human-in-the-loop controls where agents can work autonomously within defined boundaries but require approval for high-risk actions (deployments, external API calls, etc.).\n\n3. **Observability Through Chat History**: Transform our existing chat parsing into real-time observability - capturing agent conversations, decisions, and actions for performance analysis and debugging.\n\n4. **Prompt Optimization Pipeline**: Use historical chat data to identify patterns in successful vs. failed agent interactions, enabling data-driven prompt engineering and workflow optimization.\n\n5. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Design protocols for agents to collaborate - one agent for architecture design, another for implementation, another for testing - with coordination mechanisms to ensure coherent results.\n\nThe Docker implementation completed here becomes the foundation for agent isolation and resource management, but the vision is much broader than automated testing."

    "businessContext": "The landscape of AI coding assistants has fundamentally shifted. GitHub Copilot now features autonomous agent mode that can perform complex coding tasks under human supervision, not just code completion. This evolution requires a paradigm shift from passive chat history parsing to active AI agent orchestration and workflow management. The @devlog/ai package needs to evolve from analyzing historical data to managing and optimizing autonomous AI workflows, with chat history parsing serving as the observability layer for agent performance analysis and prompt optimization.",
    "technicalContext": "The architecture must transition from single-purpose Docker containers running VS Code to a comprehensive AI agent orchestration platform. This includes: 1) Agent lifecycle management (spawn, monitor, coordinate multiple agents), 2) Workflow orchestration (multi-step autonomous tasks), 3) Real-time observability (chat history capture for performance analysis), 4) Prompt optimization pipelines (using historical data to improve agent prompts), 5) Resource management (Docker/container orchestration for agent isolation), and 6) Human-in-the-loop controls (supervision, approval gates, intervention mechanisms).",
