  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Fix three critical UI issues with the overview stats component:\n\n1. **Open/Closed not highlighted**: When \"Open\" or \"Closed\" filters are active, they should be highlighted like \"Total\" when selected, but the current `isStatusActive` function only checks for individual DevlogStatus values, not aggregate types like 'open' and 'closed'.\n\n2. **Status (granular) not selectable**: Individual status items in the popovers should be clickable to filter by specific status, but they currently don't have click handlers or visual feedback.\n\n3. **Gap in status popover too large**: The spacing in the popover content needs to be tightened for better visual hierarchy.\n\n## Current Problems\n\n**Highlighting Issues:**\n- `isStatusActive` function only checks `currentFilters?.status?.includes(status)` which works for individual statuses but not 'open'/'closed' aggregates\n- When 'open' filter is active, it sets status to `['new', 'in-progress', 'blocked', 'in-review', 'testing']` but the highlighting logic doesn't recognize this as 'open' being active\n\n**Selection Issues:**\n- Individual status items in popovers are not clickable\n- No visual feedback for clickable individual statuses\n\n**Spacing Issues:**\n- Popover content has too much gap between status items",

      "content": "Successfully fixed all three critical UI issues with the overview stats component:\n\n1. **✅ Open/Closed highlighting**: Implemented proper active state detection for aggregate filter types ('open', 'closed') by adding `isOpenActive()` and `isClosedActive()` functions that check if the current filter status array exactly matches the corresponding aggregate status arrays.\n\n2. **✅ Status granular selection**: Made individual status items in popovers clickable by adding click handlers and tooltips to each status item in the popover content. Users can now click on specific statuses like \"New\", \"In Progress\", \"Done\", etc. to filter by that specific status.\n\n3. **✅ Popover gap reduction**: Reduced the grid gap in `.popoverStats` from 12px to 8px and added padding to individual status items for better touch targets while maintaining clean visual hierarchy.\n\n**Technical Changes:**\n- Added `isOpenActive()` and `isClosedActive()` helper functions to properly detect aggregate filter states\n- Updated `getStatClasses()` to handle 'open' and 'closed' filter types with proper active state detection\n- Added click handlers and tooltips to all individual status items in popovers\n- Updated CSS for better spacing and visual feedback\n- Made the icon variant popover items clickable as well for consistency\n\n**Testing Results:**\n- ✅ Open button highlights properly when open filter is active \n- ✅ Closed button highlights properly when closed filter is active\n- ✅ Individual status items in popovers are clickable and show proper tooltips\n- ✅ Popover spacing is tighter and more visually appealing\n- ✅ All filtering behavior maintains consistency with existing functionality"
