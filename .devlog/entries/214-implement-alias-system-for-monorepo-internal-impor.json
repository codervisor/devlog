This will improve maintainability by reducing import path fragility when files move and make code more readable. Focus on internal imports within packages while preserving existing cross-package @devlog/* aliases.",

      "content": "**Analysis Complete - Starting Implementation Plan:**\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- ✅ Root tsconfig.json has @devlog/* for cross-package imports (working well)\n- ✅ packages/web already has @/* alias for app/* directory (good pattern)\n- ✅ packages/core has specific @devlog/ai alias pointing to ../ai/build\n- ⚠️ Complex relative imports in core package: ../../types/, ../../../storage/\n- ⚠️ MCP package has simpler structure but still uses ./tools/, ./types/ patterns\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n1. **Phase 1**: Configure package-specific aliases in tsconfig.json files\n   - @core/* for packages/core/src/* \n   - @mcp/* for packages/mcp/src/*\n   - @ai/* for packages/ai/src/*\n   - Enhance @/* for packages/web (already partially done)\n\n2. **Phase 2**: Replace internal relative imports with aliases\n   - Focus on core package first (most complex imports)\n   - Update MCP package imports\n   - Update AI package imports\n   - Preserve cross-package @devlog/* imports unchanged\n\n3. **Phase 3**: Update build configurations\n   - Ensure Next.js supports new aliases\n   - Verify turbo build system compatibility\n   - Update any bundler configs if needed\n\n**Benefits Expected:**\n- More stable imports when files move (recent core reorganization would be easier)\n- Clearer code navigation and understanding\n- Consistent alias patterns across monorepo"
