This includes moving GitHub-specific utilities (emoji-mappings, rate-limiter, lru-cache), database-specific utilities (sql-time-series), and creating a shared/ folder for cross-provider utilities.",

GitHub utilities (emoji-mappings, rate-limiter, lru-cache) moved to storage/github/, database utilities (sql-time-series) moved to storage/typeorm/, and shared storage utilities (storage, time-series) moved to storage/shared/. Updated all import paths, maintained public API exports, and verified all packages build successfully. The codebase now has much better organization with logical groupings that eliminate cross-concerns and improve developer experience."
