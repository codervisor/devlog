      "content": "**QUICK FIX IMPLEMENTED** ✅\n\n✅ **Solution Applied:**\n- Created stub implementations for all chat tool handlers\n- Each handler returns \"not yet implemented\" message with explanation\n- Re-enabled chat tools in tools/index.ts and main server\n- Updated all imports and tool registrations\n\n✅ **Immediate Benefits:**\n- ✅ MCP package builds successfully\n- ✅ Chat tools are available in MCP interface \n- ✅ Users get clear feedback that features are coming soon\n- ✅ No breaking changes or compilation errors\n\n✅ **Next Steps for Full Implementation:**\n1. Add chat methods to WorkspaceDevlogManager\n2. Integrate ChatImportService with workspace architecture\n3. Implement workspace-aware chat storage and linking\n4. Replace stub implementations with real functionality\n\nThe chat tools are now functional with informative placeholder responses while we work on the full workspace integration."
