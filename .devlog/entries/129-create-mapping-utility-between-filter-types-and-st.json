  "description": "Create a centralized mapping utility to handle the relationship between FilterType values and their corresponding DevlogStatus arrays. This will eliminate hardcoded status arrays scattered throughout the codebase and provide a single source of truth for status groupings.\n\nCurrent problems:\n1. Hardcoded status arrays in devlog-manager.ts (line 347)\n2. No centralized definition of what constitutes \"open\" vs \"closed\" statuses\n3. FilterType is defined but not fully utilized in filtering logic\n4. Inconsistent handling of status groupings across components\n\nThe utility should:\n- Map FilterType values ('open', 'closed', 'total', individual statuses) to DevlogStatus arrays\n- Provide helper functions for common operations\n- Be easily extensible for future status categories\n- Integrate seamlessly with existing filtering logic",

      "content": "Successfully implemented the filter mapping utility with comprehensive functionality:\n\n✅ **Core Implementation**:\n- Created `/src/utils/filter-mapping.ts` with complete mapping between FilterType and DevlogStatus arrays\n- Exported through utils index and main core index for easy access\n- Replaced hardcoded status array in devlog-manager.ts with utility function\n\n✅ **Features Delivered**:\n- `FILTER_TYPE_TO_STATUSES` constant as single source of truth\n- Helper functions: `getStatusesForFilterType()`, `isStatusInFilterType()`, `getOpenStatuses()`, `getClosedStatuses()`, etc.\n- Status categorization functions: `isOpenStatus()`, `isClosedStatus()`, `getFilterTypeForStatus()`\n- `filterTypeToStatusFilter()` for integration with filtering operations\n\n✅ **Quality Assurance**:\n- Comprehensive test suite with 20 test cases covering all functionality\n- Consistency checks ensuring no overlap between open/closed categories\n- All tests passing ✅\n- TypeScript compilation successful ✅\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing filtering logic\n\n✅ **Integration**:\n- Updated devlog-manager.ts to use `getOpenStatuses()` instead of hardcoded array\n- Preserved existing behavior (including 'done' status in default filter)\n- Ready for use across the entire @devlog/core package",
