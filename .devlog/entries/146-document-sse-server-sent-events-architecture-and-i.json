The system has a sophisticated multi-process architecture:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐\n│   MCP Server    │    │   File System   │    │   Web Server    │\n│   (VS Code)     │    │   (.devlog/     │    │   (Next.js)     │\n│                 │    │    events/)     │    │                 │\n│  DevlogManager  │───▶│  Event Files    │───▶│ CrossProcess    │\n│                 │    │                 │    │ EventSystem     │\n└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘\n                                                       │\n                                                       ▼\n                                               ┌─────────────────┐\n                                               │ SSE Event Bridge│\n                                               │                 │\n                                               │ Listens to      │\n                                               │ cross-process   │\n                                               │ events          │\n                                               └─────────────────┘\n                                                       │\n                                                       ▼\n                                               ┌─────────────────┐\n                                               │ SSE Manager     │\n                                               │                 │\n                                               │ Broadcasts to   │\n                                               │ all connected   │\n                                               │ clients         │\n                                               └─────────────────┘\n                                                       │\n                                                       ▼\n                                               ┌─────────────────┐\n                                               │ Browser Clients │\n                                               │                 │\n                                               │ EventSource     │\n                                               │ /api/events     │\n                                               └─────────────────┘\n```\n\n### 🔄 Event Flow\n\n**1. Event Generation (MCP Server)**\n- DevlogManager performs CRUD operations\n- Emits events to both local and cross-process systems:\n  ```typescript\n  await this.emitEvent({\n    type: 'created',\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    data: entry,\n  });\n  ```\n\n**2. Cross-Process Communication**\n- CrossProcessEventSystem writes events to `.devlog/events/` as JSON files\n- Filename format: `{timestamp}-{eventId}-{eventType}.json`\n- Files contain event data + metadata (processId, timestamp)\n\n**3. File-Based Event Polling**\n- Web server polls `.devlog/events/` every 500ms\n- Processes new events and deletes consumed files\n- Skips events from same process to avoid double-processing\n\n**4. SSE Event Bridge**\n- Initialized when first client connects to `/api/events`\n- Listens to cross-process events: `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `note-added`\n- Converts devlog events to SSE broadcasts\n\n**5. SSE Broadcasting**\n- SSE Manager maintains active connections Set\n- Broadcasts JSON messages to all connected clients:\n  ```typescript\n  const message = JSON.stringify({\n    type: 'devlog-created',\n    data: devlogEntry,\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n  });\n  ```\n\n**6. Client-Side Updates**\n- `useServerSentEvents` hook manages EventSource connection\n- Automatic reconnection on errors (3 second delay)\n- `useDevlogs` hook subscribes to events for real-time UI updates\n\n### 📡 SSE Events\n\n**Connection Events:**\n- `connected` - Client successfully connected to SSE stream\n\n**Devlog Events:**\n- `devlog-created` - New devlog entry was created\n- `devlog-updated` - Existing devlog entry was updated  \n- `devlog-deleted` - Devlog entry was deleted (includes ID + timestamp)\n\n### 🛠️ Key Components\n\n**Core Package:**\n- `CrossProcessEventSystem` - File-based inter-process communication\n- `DevlogEventEmitter` - Local event system\n- `DevlogManager` - Emits events on CRUD operations\n\n**Web Package:**\n- `/api/events/route.ts` - SSE endpoint with ReadableStream\n- `SSEEventBridge` - Connects cross-process events to SSE\n- `SSEManager` - Manages active connections and broadcasting\n- `useServerSentEvents` - React hook for SSE connection\n- `useDevlogs` - React hook with real-time updates\n\n### 🔧 Real-Time Update Mechanism\n\n1. **User creates devlog via MCP** → DevlogManager.create()\n2. **Event emitted** → CrossProcessEventSystem writes file\n3. **Web server polls** → Finds new event file\n4. **SSE Bridge triggers** → Broadcasts to connected clients\n5. **Browser receives** → useDevlogs updates state automatically\n6. **UI updates** → New devlog appears without refresh\n\n### 🐛 Known Issues\n\n- **Intermittent Updates**: Sometimes events don't reach all clients (documented in devlog #142)\n- **Connection Timing**: SSE bridge only initializes when first client connects\n- **Race Conditions**: Possible timing issues between MCP and Web server instances\n\n### 💡 Benefits of SSE over WebSocket\n\n- ✅ Native Next.js App Router compatibility\n- ✅ No custom server setup required\n- ✅ Better browser support and reliability  \n- ✅ Simpler implementation and debugging\n- ✅ Automatic reconnection built-in\n- ✅ Server-to-client only (perfect for notifications)"
