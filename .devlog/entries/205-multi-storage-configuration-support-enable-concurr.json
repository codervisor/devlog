  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Currently, the devlog system only supports one storage type at a time via environment variables (DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE). This creates a pain point during development where switching to test other storage types (GitHub, PostgreSQL, etc.) requires temporarily disabling JSON storage, causing loss of access to current devlogs.\n\nWe need a solution that allows concurrent access to multiple storage types during development and testing.",
