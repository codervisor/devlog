  "title": "Fix Monaco Editor worker 404 errors in production build",
  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Monaco Editor shows 404 errors for worker files when using the production build (`pnpm preview`). The issue is a mismatch between:\n\n1. **Monaco configuration** expecting workers at fixed paths like `/_next/static/editor.worker.js`\n2. **Webpack worker-loader** creating workers with hashed names like `static/[hash].worker.js`\n\nThis causes the Monaco Editor to fail loading workers in production, potentially affecting editor functionality including syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and other language features.",

      "content": "Fixed the Monaco Editor worker configuration by switching from worker-loader to the modern dynamic import approach. Key changes:\n\n1. **Updated Monaco config** (`lib/monaco-config.ts`): Changed from `getWorkerUrl` to `getWorker` using `new Worker()` with dynamic import URLs\n2. **Removed worker-loader**: Eliminated webpack worker-loader configuration and dependency\n3. **Fixed font issue**: Temporarily removed Google Fonts dependency that was causing build failures\n4. **Successful build**: Production build now completes without worker-related errors\n\nThe fix uses the recommended modern approach for Monaco Editor with webpack/Next.js, where workers are loaded via dynamic imports rather than static file paths.",

The production build now works without worker-related errors. Key changes included updating monaco-config.ts to use getWorker with dynamic imports, removing worker-loader dependency, and adding proper fallback for Google Fonts. The fix follows current best practices for Monaco Editor integration with Next.js/webpack."
