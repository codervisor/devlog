Add contextual triggers and pattern-based detection to make implicit migration needs explicit during normal development workflow. This addresses the gap where changes to core classes or interfaces don't trigger conscious migration awareness.",

      "content": "✅ **AUTOMATIC MIGRATION DETECTION IMPLEMENTED**\n\n## Solution: Making Implicit Migration Needs Explicit\n\n### **1. File Pattern Triggers** \n✅ Added to all instruction files:\n- **High-impact file patterns**: Automatic warnings when editing managers, types, storage\n- **Cross-package change indicators**: Build errors, import errors trigger migration checks\n- **Auto-check commands**: Built-in grep patterns for impact discovery\n\n### **2. Contextual Prompts**\n✅ Enhanced `copilot-instructions.md`:\n- **Automatic triggers** based on file patterns being edited\n- **Contextual warnings** for specific architectural components  \n- **Proactive detection** before starting development sessions\n- **Integration** with existing workflow\n\n### **3. Automatic Detection Script**\n✅ Created `scripts/detect-migration.js`:\n- **Git-based analysis**: Scans recent changes for migration triggers\n- **Cross-package impact mapping**: Identifies affected dependencies automatically\n- **Usage pattern discovery**: Searches for class/interface usage across packages\n- **Clear actionable output**: Shows what needs migration attention\n\n### **4. Workflow Integration**\n✅ Added to package scripts:\n- `pnpm detect-migration` - Run automatic detection\n- Integrated into development workflow prompts\n- Added to pre-commit documentation\n\n## Real-World Test Results:\nThe script successfully detected all the WorkspaceDevlogManager cross-package usages that caused bugs #220, #217, #222, #225 - exactly the 60% migration issue pattern we needed to solve!",
