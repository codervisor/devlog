    "technicalContext": "Currently, stats are displayed in three different components with similar but not identical styling and logic:\n1. Dashboard component - detailed stats in header with all status types\n2. NavigationSidebar - compact stats card with total, in-progress, completed  \n3. DevlogList - sticky header stats with total, in-progress, done, todo, blocked\n\nEach has its own CSS and slightly different data handling, making maintenance difficult and creating inconsistency.",
