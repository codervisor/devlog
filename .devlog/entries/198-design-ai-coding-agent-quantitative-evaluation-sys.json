      "content": "Started comprehensive design analysis. Examined existing devlog project architecture patterns, TypeORM entities, and core type definitions. System follows modular architecture with clear separation between core types, storage providers, and MCP adapters. This provides excellent foundation for building evaluation system components that integrate well with existing patterns."
