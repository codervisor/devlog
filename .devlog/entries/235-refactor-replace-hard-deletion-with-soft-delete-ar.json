  "title": "Refactor: Replace Hard Deletion with Soft Delete/Archive Pattern",
  "type": "refactor",
  "description": "Replace all hard deletion operations across packages (core, ai, mcp, web) with soft delete pattern using existing archive functionality. This prevents data loss while maintaining the ability to \"remove\" entries from normal views. The existing `archived` field should be leveraged for marking entries as deleted.",

      "content": "Completed core implementation of soft delete pattern:\n\n✅ **Storage Interface Updates**:\n- Deprecated delete() methods in StorageProvider interface with @deprecated annotations\n- Updated all storage providers (JSON, TypeORM) to use archive instead of hard deletion\n- Left GitHub storage as-is since it already uses soft delete pattern (issue closing)\n\n✅ **WorkspaceDevlogManager Updates**:\n- Updated deleteDevlog() to call archiveDevlog() instead of storage provider delete()\n- Added deprecation notice directing users to use archiveDevlog() directly\n- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping same method signature\n\n✅ **Filter Updates**:\n- JSON storage already excluded archived entries by default\n- Updated TypeORM storage to exclude archived entries by default\n- Both providers respect explicit archived filter when provided\n\n✅ **Test Updates**:\n- Updated JSON storage test to verify soft delete behavior\n- Test confirms entry is archived, not physically deleted\n- Test verifies filtering behavior (excluded by default, included when requested)\n\n✅ **API Route Updates**:\n- Updated comments in web API routes to reflect soft deletion\n- No code changes needed since routes use manager methods we've already updated\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Build and test the complete system\n- Verify web app functionality works correctly with soft delete\n- Complete the devlog entry",
