  "description": "Create a new concept alongside devlog entries specifically for storing high-level design documents, architectural plans, and technical specifications. This would provide a persistent, searchable, and versioned way to store project documentation that complements the task-oriented devlog entries.",

    "businessContext": "Currently, high-level design documents and architectural plans are scattered across separate markdown files in the docs/ directory, making them disconnected from the development workflow tracked in devlog entries. Having a unified system for both granular task tracking (devlog entries) and high-level documentation (design documents) would create a comprehensive knowledge management system where all project information is discoverable, searchable, and properly versioned within the same ecosystem.",
    "technicalContext": "The system should leverage the existing devlog storage infrastructure but introduce a new entity type (e.g., 'design-doc', 'architecture-doc', 'technical-spec') with different metadata structure optimized for documentation. This could include fields like document type, version, stakeholders, approval status, and relationships to devlog entries that implement the designs.",
