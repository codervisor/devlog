  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The timeseries stats API currently defaults to 30 days when no specific date range is provided, which may be limiting results to fewer data points than expected. Users may expect to see more historical data by default or have configurable limits.",

The problem was that the new 'closedAt' field was missing from existing closed entries, causing the timeseries calculation to not count historical completed work properly. Created and ran a migration script that populated closedAt=updatedAt for 142 existing closed entries. The timeseries stats should now display historical data correctly."
