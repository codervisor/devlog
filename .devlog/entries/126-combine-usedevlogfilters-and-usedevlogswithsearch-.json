The current architecture has duplication and separation of concerns that can be improved by merging client-side filtering logic with server-side search and pagination functionality.",

    "technicalContext": "Currently, useDevlogsWithSearch handles server-side operations (fetch, create, update, delete, pagination) while useDevlogFilters handles client-side filtering. These can be merged into a single hook that provides both server-side and client-side capabilities while maintaining the same external API.",
