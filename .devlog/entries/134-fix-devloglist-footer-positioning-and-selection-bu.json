The selection action buttons (Update, Add Note, Delete) are positioned in the center, but should be aligned with the selection count on the left side\n\nThese issues affect the user experience and table usability, especially when dealing with large lists or batch operations.",

The table footer now uses sticky positioning for better integration with Ant Design's table layout, and the selection action buttons (Update, Add Note, Delete) are properly aligned with the selection count on the left side. Both issues have been resolved while maintaining all existing functionality and responsive design."
