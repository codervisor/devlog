  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Fix the issue where the devlog list table header with filter dropdowns disappears when there are no devlogs to display. Currently, when devlogs.length === 0, the component renders an Empty component instead of the table, which removes access to the header filters. Users should be able to access filters even when the list is empty.",
