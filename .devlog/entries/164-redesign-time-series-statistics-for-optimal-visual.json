      "content": "**Critical Insight: Add `closedAt` field instead of relying on notes**\n\nYou're absolutely correct! Using notes for completion detection is unreliable because:\n\n1. **Inconsistent user behavior**: Not all users write completion notes\n2. **Note content variability**: Different phrasing, keywords, languages\n3. **Parsing complexity**: Text analysis is error-prone and fragile\n4. **Performance overhead**: Scanning note content is inefficient\n\n**Better solution: Add `closedAt` timestamp field**\n\n```typescript\ninterface DevlogEntry {\n  // ... existing fields\n  closedAt?: string; // ISO timestamp when status changed to 'done' or 'cancelled'\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Reliable tracking**: Exact timestamp when item was closed\n- **Simple queries**: Direct field access, no text parsing\n- **Performance**: Fast database/storage queries\n- **Consistent data**: Always accurate, not dependent on user documentation habits\n- **Audit trail**: Clear historical record of when work was completed\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n1. Add `closedAt` field to DevlogEntry interface\n2. Update `completeDevlog()` and `closeDevlog()` methods to set timestamp\n3. Modify time series calculation to use `closedAt` for accurate completion dates\n4. Handle migration for existing entries (set closedAt = updatedAt for done/cancelled items)\n5. Update all storage providers consistently\n\nThis provides the reliable completion tracking we need for accurate time series visualization."

    "technicalContext": "Current implementation has several architectural flaws:\n1. **Status distribution uses current state, not historical**: Counts current status of all devlogs created by each date, rather than actual status on that date\n2. **Completion detection is unreliable**: Uses updatedAt as proxy for completion date, but updatedAt changes for any field update\n3. **No proper dual-axis visualization**: Mixes cumulative counts (created/completed) with snapshot counts (status distribution) on same axis\n4. **Poor visual representation**: Current AreaChart with stacked data doesn't clearly show the relationship between cumulative progress and current open work\n\nThe solution requires:\n- Cumulative data (created, completed, closed) for primary Y-axis showing total project progress over time\n- Snapshot data (open items by status) for secondary Y-axis showing current workload distribution\n- Proper chart visualization with dual axes and appropriate chart types",
