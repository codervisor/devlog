      "content": "Completed: Successfully implemented centralized environment loading. Created a shared utility (env-loader.ts) in @devlog/core that detects monorepo root by looking for pnpm-workspace.yaml or package.json with workspaces field. Updated all packages to use this utility instead of package-specific dotenv.config() calls. The solution ensures .env files are loaded from the root directory regardless of the current working directory, solving the issue where pnpm --filter changes working directory to the package folder. Tested and verified that web app now correctly loads environment variables when run via pnpm dev:web."
