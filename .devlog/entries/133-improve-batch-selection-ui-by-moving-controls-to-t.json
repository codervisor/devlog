  "description": "Currently, batch selection controls appear as a disruptive toolbar above the table when items are selected. This interrupts the table view and pushes content down. Instead, the batch operation controls should be integrated into the table footer area, alongside the pagination controls, for a cleaner and less intrusive user experience.",

      "category": "solution",
      "content": "Successfully restored pagination functionality! The implementation now includes:\n\n✅ **Default pagination enabled**: useDevlogs hook now sets default pagination (20 items per page, sorted by updatedAt desc)\n✅ **Functional page size selector**: Users can choose 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page\n✅ **Working page navigation**: Previous/Next buttons work correctly with proper state management\n✅ **Proper pagination info**: Shows \"Showing X-Y of Z devlogs\" and \"Page N of M\" \n✅ **Correct API integration**: Backend JSON storage provider properly handles pagination requests\n✅ **Real pagination UI**: Table footer now contains functional pagination controls instead of static elements\n\nThe pagination was previously missing because:\n- useDevlogs hook wasn't setting default pagination filters\n- DevlogList component had non-functional pagination controls\n- Page size selector was static and not connected to state\n\nThe fix involved:\n1. Setting default pagination in useDevlogs hook state\n2. Making page size selector functional with onPageSizeChange callback\n3. Adding pagination navigation with Previous/Next buttons\n4. Updating pagination info display to show actual counts\n5. Properly connecting all pagination props through the component chain"

      "content": "Successfully fixed the UX issues in pagination! Both problems have been resolved:\n\n🎯 **Issue 1 - Pagination affected during loading**: \n✅ **FIXED**: Loading state no longer disrupts pagination controls\n- Pagination controls now remain visible and stable during loading\n- Page size selector, navigation buttons, and pagination info persist\n- Loading state uses skeleton data in same table structure\n- Users can see their current page/size settings while loading\n\n🎯 **Issue 2 - Skeleton table misalignment**: \n✅ **FIXED**: Skeleton columns now perfectly match actual table structure  \n- Added checkbox column to skeleton when batch operations are enabled\n- Proper column widths and structure alignment\n- Skeleton buttons match real button sizes (View/Delete = 60px vs 70px)\n- Title column shows realistic multi-line skeleton content\n- Status/Priority/Type columns use 24px height matching real badges\n\n📋 **Implementation approach:**\n- Changed from completely hiding table during loading to overlaying skeleton data\n- Created `skeletonColumns` that dynamically match actual table structure\n- Added loading checks to disable controls appropriately (page size selector, navigation)\n- Used skeleton placeholders for dynamic content (pagination info, totals)\n- Maintained all pagination state during loading transitions\n\n**Result**: Smooth, professional UX with no jarring layout shifts or control disappearance during loading states. Users maintain context and can see their pagination settings at all times."
