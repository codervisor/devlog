  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Fixed the dangerous test cleanup that was deleting real devlog data, but tests still not properly isolated. Tests are accumulating data across runs (78 entries instead of 2 expected). Even with global: false and .devlog-test directory, DevlogManager seems to find real storage. Need complete isolation.",

Still need to solve the isolation issue - tests are reading accumulated data (78 entries) instead of starting clean.

      "content": "✅ RESOLVED: Fixed test isolation by ensuring DevlogManager.initialize() is called while still in the test directory. The issue was that ConfigurationManager.initialize() was capturing the original workspace root when getWorkspaceRoot() was called during lazy initialization. By explicitly calling manager.initialize() in beforeEach while process.cwd() is still the test directory, we ensure proper isolation. All 28 tests now pass with complete isolation.",
