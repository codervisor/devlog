      "content": "Successfully fixed all three workspace issues:\n\n✅ **Issue 1 - No initial workspace**: Fixed by correcting the priority logic in `parseTypeORMConfig()` and `AutoWorkspaceManager.determineStorageType()` to respect `DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE=json` over the presence of `POSTGRES_URL`. Now creates a default workspace on first run.\n\n✅ **Issue 2 - Unable to create new workspace**: Fixed the underlying initialization issue. Users can now successfully create new workspaces through the UI - tested with creating \"Test Workspace\" with JSON storage.\n\n✅ **Issue 3 - No skeleton loading**: The page now properly loads workspace data and displays the workspace list instead of showing indefinite loading states.\n\n**Root cause**: The auto-detection logic was prioritizing database URLs over explicit storage type configuration, causing conflicts when `POSTGRES_URL` existed but `DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE=json` was set. This led to TypeORM trying to use PostgreSQL schema with SQLite driver.",

      "content": "**Refactored Entity Files to Eliminate Code Duplication**\n\n✅ **Created shared decorators utility** (`decorators.ts`):\n- `JsonColumn` - Adapts to jsonb (PostgreSQL), json (MySQL), or text (SQLite) \n- `TimestampColumn` - Uses timestamptz (PostgreSQL) or datetime (MySQL/SQLite)\n- `TypeColumn`, `StatusColumn`, `PriorityColumn` - Enum vs varchar based on database type\n- `getTimestampType()` and `getStorageType()` helper functions\n\n✅ **Refactored both entity files**:\n- `devlog-entry.entity.ts` - Now imports shared decorators instead of duplicating logic\n- `workspace.entity.ts` - Aligned with same pattern, using conditional decorators\n\n✅ **Updated exports** - Added decorators to `entities/index.ts` for broader usage\n\n**Benefits**: \n- Eliminated ~50 lines of duplicated decorator code\n- Consistent database handling across all entities\n- Easier maintenance when adding new entities or database types\n- Single source of truth for database-specific column logic",
