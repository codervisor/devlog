      "content": "Successfully fixed all three workspace issues:\n\n✅ **Issue 1 - No initial workspace**: Fixed by correcting the priority logic in `parseTypeORMConfig()` and `AutoWorkspaceManager.determineStorageType()` to respect `DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE=json` over the presence of `POSTGRES_URL`. Now creates a default workspace on first run.\n\n✅ **Issue 2 - Unable to create new workspace**: Fixed the underlying initialization issue. Users can now successfully create new workspaces through the UI - tested with creating \"Test Workspace\" with JSON storage.\n\n✅ **Issue 3 - No skeleton loading**: The page now properly loads workspace data and displays the workspace list instead of showing indefinite loading states.\n\n**Root cause**: The auto-detection logic was prioritizing database URLs over explicit storage type configuration, causing conflicts when `POSTGRES_URL` existed but `DEVLOG_STORAGE_TYPE=json` was set. This led to TypeORM trying to use PostgreSQL schema with SQLite driver.",
