  "title": "Fix /api/devlogs endpoint - Remove default \"open only\" filter",
  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "The /api/devlogs endpoint is only returning open items due to a default filter being applied in DevlogManager.applyDefaultFilters(). When no status filter is specified, the method automatically applies getOpenStatuses() filter, excluding closed entries. This breaks the expectation that calling /api/devlogs without filters should return all entries.\n\nThe issue is in packages/core/src/devlog-manager.ts in the applyDefaultFilters method around line 351, where it applies enhancedFilter.status = getOpenStatuses() when no status filter is provided.",

Modified DevlogManager.listDevlogs() to accept an includeAllStatuses option and updated the API route to use this when no explicit filters are provided.
