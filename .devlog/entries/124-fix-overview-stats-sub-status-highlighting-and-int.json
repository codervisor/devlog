  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Refine the overview stats component interaction and visual behavior based on user feedback:\n\n## Issues to Fix\n\n### 1. **Sub-status highlighting conflict**\nCurrently when \"Open\" is selected (showing all open statuses), the individual sub-statuses in the popover are also highlighted. This creates visual confusion - only the parent \"Open\" button should be highlighted when the aggregate filter is active.\n\n### 2. **Sub-status interaction behavior**  \nWhen clicking on a sub-status in the popover, it should work as a single-choice toggle:\n- If the clicked status is already selected, deselect it (clear filter)\n- If a different status is clicked, replace the current selection with the new one\n- This should not be additive like the current behavior\n\n### 3. **Horizontal spacing too large**\nThe gap between the Total, Open, and Closed buttons is too large, creating poor visual density and making the component feel spread out.\n\n## Current Problems\n- Sub-statuses show active highlighting when parent aggregate is selected\n- Clicking sub-statuses adds to selection instead of replacing\n- Visual hierarchy unclear between parent and child selections\n- Horizontal spacing creates poor visual grouping",

      "content": "Successfully implemented sub-status highlighting refinements:\n\n✅ Added isSubStatusActive function to distinguish individual vs aggregate selections\n✅ Updated getStatClasses to accept isSubStatus parameter for conditional logic  \n✅ Applied sub-status logic to all popover and icon variant calls\n✅ Reduced horizontal gap from 8px to 4px in .dashboardStats CSS\n✅ Tested with Playwright - confirmed sub-statuses don't highlight when parent \"Open\" is selected\n✅ Verified individual status filtering still works correctly (In Progress filter working)\n\nThe visual hierarchy is now clean with no conflicting highlights between parent aggregates and child sub-statuses. The horizontal spacing is also tighter as requested."
