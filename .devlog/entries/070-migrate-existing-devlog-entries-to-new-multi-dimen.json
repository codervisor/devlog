  "description": "Migrate all existing devlog entries (73 entries) from the old 16-digit timestamp-based IDs to the new 8-digit multi-dimensional ID format {agent}{julianDay}{sequence}. This will provide consistency across all entries and ensure users get the full benefit of readable IDs for all devlog operations.\n\nThe migration needs to:\n1. Read all existing entries with timestamp-based IDs \n2. Generate new multi-dimensional IDs while preserving chronological order\n3. Update file names from old format to new format\n4. Preserve all entry data, notes, and metadata\n5. Handle any potential conflicts or edge cases\n6. Validate the migration was successful\n\nThis will complete the transition to the new ID system across the entire devlog history.",

      "content": "📊 **Migration Scope Analysis - Three ID Formats Discovered**\n\n## Current ID Format Breakdown:\nAfter analyzing the 74 total entries, we have **three different ID formats** to migrate:\n\n### 1. **Simple Incremental IDs** (Oldest Format)\nExamples: `79`, `95`, `96`, `94`, `93`, `92`, `91`, `90`, `89`, `87`, `88`, `86`, `85`, `84`, `83`, `81`, `82`, `80`, `52`, `49`, `51`, `50`, `48`, `47`, `37`, `45`, `46`, `44`, `43`, `42`, `38`, `41`, `40`, `39`, `36`, `35`, `34`, `33`, `31`, `32`, `30`, `29`, `28`, `27`, `26`, `25`, `24`, `6`, `23`, `22`, `21`, `19`, `20`, `18`, `15`, `16`, `13`, `12`, `11`, `10`, `7`, `9`, `8`, `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`\n- **Count**: ~64 entries\n- **Range**: ID 2 to ID 96\n- **System**: Simple sequential counter\n\n### 2. **16-Digit Timestamp IDs** (Previous Format)  \nExamples: `1752562925996056`, `1752563187964821`, `1752563096567280`, `1752563030472590`, `1752560981846444`, `1752554397516337`\n- **Count**: ~8 entries\n- **Format**: 16-digit timestamp + 3-digit random\n- **System**: Timestamp-based for multi-agent safety\n\n### 3. **8-Digit Multi-Dimensional IDs** (New Format - Target)\nExamples: `57126001`, `57126002`\n- **Count**: 2 entries (newly created)\n- **Format**: {agent}{julianDay}{sequence}\n- **System**: Multi-dimensional readable format\n\n## Migration Strategy:\n1. **Preserve chronological order** by sorting all entries by creation date\n2. **Assign new sequential IDs** in chronological order using the agent hash + day + sequence\n3. **Handle multiple formats** in the migration script\n4. **Maintain all metadata** during the transition\n\nThis is a more complex migration than initially planned!"

      "content": "🎉 **MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!**\n\n## Migration Results:\n- ✅ **All 75 entries migrated** to new multi-dimensional ID format\n- ✅ **Backup created** at `.devlog/backup-pre-migration/`\n- ✅ **Chronological order preserved** based on creation dates\n- ✅ **All ID formats handled**: Simple incremental, timestamp-based, and multi-dimensional\n\n## Format Analysis Before Migration:\n- Simple Incremental (1-3 digits): 67 entries\n- Timestamp-based (13+ digits): 6 entries  \n- Multi-dimensional (7-10 digits): 2 entries\n\n## Format Analysis After Migration:\n- **Multi-dimensional format: 75 entries (100%)**\n- Old formats remaining: 0 entries\n\n## Examples of Successful Migration:\n- `79` → `57121011` (incremental to multi-dimensional)\n- `1752562925996056` → `57126006` (timestamp to multi-dimensional) \n- Entries properly sequenced by creation date across different days\n\n## ID Structure Breakdown:\n- **Agent Hash**: `571` (consistent for this migration agent)\n- **Julian Days**: `5717`, `5718`, `57112`, `57114`, `57115`, `57120`, `57121`, `57122`, `57125`, `57126` \n- **Sequences**: Properly incremented within each day\n\n## Benefits Achieved:\n- 📊 **Massive readability improvement**: From 16-digit timestamps to 8-digit readable IDs\n- 🎯 **Consistent format**: All entries now use the same ID structure\n- 📅 **Chronological organization**: IDs reflect creation timeline\n- 🔒 **Multi-agent safety**: Maintained through agent hash partitioning\n\nThe migration script worked perfectly and all devlog history is now accessible with readable IDs!"
