  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Add text search functionality to the @devlog/web interface. The backend already has search capabilities through DevlogManager.searchDevlogs() method, but the web interface doesn't expose this functionality. This feature should include a search input field and integrate with the existing filtering system.",

    "businessContext": "Users need to be able to quickly find specific devlogs by searching through titles, descriptions, and notes content. The current filtering system only supports categorical filters (status, type, priority) but lacks text-based search capability, which limits user productivity when working with large numbers of devlog entries.",
    "technicalContext": "The backend search functionality is already implemented via DevlogManager.searchDevlogs() method and all storage providers (JSON, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, GitHub) support text search. The web interface uses useDevlogFilters hook for filtering but needs to be extended to support search queries. The API route at /api/devlogs needs to accept a search query parameter.",
