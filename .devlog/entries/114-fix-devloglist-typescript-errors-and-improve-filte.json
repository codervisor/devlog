      "content": "Completed: Successfully resolved all three issues:\n\n## ✅ Issue 1: TypeScript Errors in DevlogList.tsx\n**Fixed**: Replaced all inline CSS styles with proper CSS classes in DevlogList.module.css:\n- Added `searchDropdownMenu`, `searchDropdownInputContainer`, `searchDropdownActions` classes\n- Added `batchActionsToolbar`, `batchDeleteList`, `batchDeleteItem` classes  \n- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved\n\n## ✅ Issue 2: Missing Types for Status Categories\n**Fixed**: Added proper FilterType definition to core types system:\n- Added `FilterType = DevlogStatus | 'total' | 'open' | 'closed'` to core/types/core.ts\n- Updated useDevlogFilters and OverviewStats to import FilterType from @devlog/core\n- Removed duplicate local FilterType definitions for centralized typing\n\n## ✅ Issue 3: Unnecessary Stats Refresh on Filtering\n**Fixed**: Separated stats management from filtering to prevent unnecessary API calls:\n- Modified useStats hook to only fetch once on mount (removed dependencies parameter)\n- Stats now represent overall system state, not filtered view\n- Stats only refresh on actual CRUD operations (create, update, delete)\n- Added smart refresh logic: stats refetch after delete/batch operations and on page visibility change\n\n## 🎯 Verification Results\n- **TypeScript**: All compilation errors resolved ✅\n- **FilterType System**: Proper typing throughout codebase ✅  \n- **Stats Behavior**: No unnecessary refreshes during filtering ✅\n- **Filtering Functionality**: Open/closed filtering works correctly ✅\n- **User Experience**: Clean UI with stable stats during filtering ✅\n\n**Technical Approach**: \n- Server-side filtering maintained for efficiency (no client-side data loading)\n- Stats calculated server-side and cached until actual data changes\n- Proper separation of concerns: filtering affects data view, stats represent system state"
