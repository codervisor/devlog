HomeIcon (16px Lucide React icon) is not vertically centered within the breadcrumb item\n2. The breadcrumb component itself may not be properly aligned within the page header\n\nPage header layout uses flexbox with align-items: center and page-header-left class has display: flex; align-items: center; but this may not be sufficient for the icon within the breadcrumb items.\n\nWill implement CSS fixes to ensure proper vertical alignment at both the breadcrumb container and icon levels."
