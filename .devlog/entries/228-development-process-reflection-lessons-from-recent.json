      "content": "## ⚠️ Critical Process Gaps Identified\n\n### 1. **Incomplete Architecture Migration Strategy**\n**Gap**: No systematic approach for large architectural changes\n- Components updated individually without dependency mapping\n- No checklist for \"what needs updating when X changes\"\n- MCP adapter, web app, and core package updated at different times\n- **Result**: 6+ bugs from incomplete WorkspaceDevlogManager migration\n\n### 2. **Missing Integration Testing**\n**Gap**: Components tested in isolation, not as integrated system\n- WorkspaceDevlogManager worked fine but MCP adapter wasn't updated\n- Field mapping worked in core but not exposed through workspace layer\n- **Result**: Runtime failures in production-like environments\n\n### 3. **Inadequate Prompt/Documentation Synchronization**\n**Gap**: Code patterns ahead of documented guidelines\n- ESM import patterns implemented but not documented\n- Import guidelines missing from instruction files\n- **Result**: Inconsistent patterns, AI agents applying outdated practices\n\n### 4. **Reactive vs Proactive State Management**\n**Gap**: UI state issues discovered through bugs, not design\n- Multiple components independently managing same state\n- No centralized state management strategy\n- **Result**: UI synchronization bugs, poor user experience"
