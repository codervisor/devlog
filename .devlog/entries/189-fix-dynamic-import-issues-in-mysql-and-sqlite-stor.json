SQLite Storage (sqlite-storage.ts:88-95)**:\n```typescript\n// Complex fallback with eval approach\nsqlite3Module = await import('better-sqlite3');\n// Falls back to: eval('(specifier) => import(specifier)')\n```\n- Complex import fallback logic may cause bundling issues\n- Missing TypeScript support (@types/better-sqlite3 not in devDependencies)\n- Eval-based fallback is problematic for CSP and bundlers\n\n**3. Missing TypeScript Dependencies**:\n- No @types/mysql2 in devDependencies (only mysql2 in peerDependencies)\n- No @types/better-sqlite3 in devDependencies (only better-sqlite3 in peerDependencies)\n\n**Impact**: Same serverless deployment failures as PostgreSQL #188",

      "content": "✅ **ALL STORAGE PROVIDERS FIXED** - Dynamic import issues resolved!\n\n**FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**\n\n**1. MySQL Storage Provider:**\n- ✅ Removed `as any` type assertion from `await import('mysql2/promise')`\n- ✅ Clean import pattern: `await import('mysql2/promise')`\n- ✅ MySQL2 has built-in TypeScript types (no separate @types package needed)\n\n**2. SQLite Storage Provider:**\n- ✅ Removed complex eval-based fallback logic that could break bundlers\n- ✅ Simplified to clean `await import('better-sqlite3')`\n- ✅ Added `@types/better-sqlite3` to devDependencies for TypeScript support\n- ✅ Eliminated CSP-problematic `eval('(specifier) => import(specifier)')` code\n\n**3. Package Dependencies:**\n- ✅ Added `@types/better-sqlite3` for SQLite TypeScript support\n- ✅ MySQL2 doesn't need separate types (built-in)\n- ✅ All storage providers now have consistent import patterns\n\n**BUILD VERIFICATION:**\n- ✅ Core package builds successfully (2.5s)\n- ✅ Full web build completes without errors (25s)\n- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes\n- ✅ No dynamic import warnings or bundling issues\n\n**CONSISTENCY ACHIEVED:**\nAll storage providers now use the same clean pattern:\n```typescript\nconst module = await import('package-name');\n```\n\nNo more serverless deployment risks from problematic import patterns!",
