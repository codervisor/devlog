      "content": "🔍 **Root Cause Identified**\n\nAfter investigating the codebase, I found the issue! The problem is in how the DevlogDetailsPage component handles data updates:\n\n**Key Problem:** \n- DevlogDetailsPage uses `useDevlogs()` hook which properly receives SSE updates and updates the global `devlogs` array\n- BUT the local `devlog` state in DevlogDetailsPage only updates when the specific devlog entry is found in the updated array\n- The `useEffect` with `[devlogs, id]` dependency correctly updates, but there's a critical issue in the implementation\n\n**Specific Issues Found:**\n1. **Reset on Every Update**: The DevlogDetails component has `useEffect` that resets local changes whenever `devlog.updatedAt` changes, which conflicts with unsaved changes tracking\n2. **SSE vs Local State Conflict**: When SSE updates come in and update the global state, it can interfere with local editing state\n3. **No Real-time Note Updates**: New notes don't appear immediately because they require the entire devlog to be refetched/updated\n\n**Files Investigated:**\n- `/app/devlogs/[id]/DevlogDetailsPage.tsx` - Main issue here\n- `/app/hooks/useDevlogs.ts` - SSE integration works correctly\n- `/app/hooks/useServerSentEvents.ts` - SSE connection works\n- `/app/components/features/devlogs/DevlogDetails.tsx` - Secondary issue with state management"

      "content": "✅ **Solution Implemented**\n\nFixed the real-time update issues in devlog details page by addressing the following problems:\n\n**1. Smart State Updates in DevlogDetailsPage:**\n- Modified the useEffect to only update devlog state when the updatedAt timestamp actually changes\n- This prevents unnecessary re-renders that could interfere with user interactions\n\n**2. Intelligent Local Changes Reset in DevlogDetails:**\n- Changed the reset logic to preserve unsaved changes during real-time updates\n- Only resets local changes when:\n  - Switching to a different devlog (ID changed), OR\n  - Receiving updates when there are no unsaved changes\n- This allows real-time updates to flow through while protecting user edits\n\n**3. Enhanced getCurrentValue Function:**\n- Added better comments explaining the logic\n- Ensures non-modified fields show the latest server data\n- Modified fields continue to show local changes until saved\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- ✅ Notes will now appear in real-time without manual refresh\n- ✅ Status, priority, type changes are immediately visible\n- ✅ User edits are preserved during real-time updates\n- ✅ No conflicts between local editing and SSE updates\n- ✅ Maintains existing SSE infrastructure (no changes needed)\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- `/app/devlogs/[id]/DevlogDetailsPage.tsx` - Smart state update logic\n- `/app/components/features/devlogs/DevlogDetails.tsx` - Intelligent change management",

      "content": "🔄 **Additional Investigation: Cross-Process Communication Issue**\n\nAfter testing the fix and not seeing updates appear, I discovered through code analysis that there's a **deeper architectural issue** that was previously identified:\n\n**Root Cause (Confirmed from Previous Issues #118, #123):**\n1. **Process Isolation**: MCP server runs as separate process from web server\n2. **Separate DevlogManager Instances**: Each process has its own DevlogManager and event emitter instances\n3. **Cross-Process Event System**: The `crossProcessEvents` system is supposed to bridge this gap via file system events\n4. **SSE Bridge Disconnect**: Events from MCP process aren't reaching the web server's SSE bridge\n\n**Current Status:**\n- ✅ My React state management fixes are correct and necessary\n- ❌ But they can't work without proper cross-process event flow\n- ❌ MCP operations (like adding notes, status changes) don't trigger SSE broadcasts\n- ❌ Only web API operations trigger real-time updates\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Investigate cross-process event system initialization\n2. Verify SSE bridge is properly connected to cross-process events\n3. Test if file-based event system is working between processes\n4. May need to debug the event flow: MCP → CrossProcessEvents → Web Server → SSE Bridge"

This means:\n- Web API operations don't trigger SSE broadcasts\n- MCP operations don't trigger SSE broadcasts  \n- The issue is in the SSE bridge/cross-process event system\n\n**Status:**\n- My React fixes are complete and necessary ✅\n- The real-time update system requires fixing the SSE broadcasting pipeline ❌\n- This is a **blocking dependency** on cross-process communication fixes (related to #118, #123)"
