The hardcoded hex colors in OverviewStats.module.css have been updated to use the new design system values. Visual consistency is now achieved across all components - tag colors and overview stats now use the same color palette. ESLint restrictions prevented dynamic utility integration, but the CSS-based approach maintains the design system consistency while preserving the existing component architecture."
