      "content": "Redesigned workspace switcher for elegant integration! Replaced prominent dropdown with subtle button that looks like a natural menu item. Key improvements: 1) Button design matches sidebar aesthetics with swap icon, workspace name, and subtle arrow, 2) Dropdown menu with workspace details only appears on click, 3) Current workspace highlighted in blue, 4) Compact icon-only mode when sidebar collapsed, 5) Seamless hover effects and transitions. Now feels like an integrated part of the navigation rather than a disruptive widget."

Changes: 1) Removed margin from switcher container, 2) Reduced button padding from 8px to 6px, 3) Reduced container padding from 4-8px to 0-4px, 4) Compressed dropdown menu padding from 4px to 2px, 5) Tightened menu item spacing from 8-12px to 6-10px, 6) Reduced responsive padding further. Now much more compact and better integrated with sidebar layout."
