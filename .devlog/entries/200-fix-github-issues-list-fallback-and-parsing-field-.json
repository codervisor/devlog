      "content": "🔍 **ANALYZED FALLBACK ISSUE**\n\n**Root Cause**: The `list()` method in GitHubStorageProvider has flawed search logic:\n\n1. **Primary search** uses restrictive label-based queries that often return 0 results\n2. **Fallback trigger** activates when search is empty AND no filters applied  \n3. **Fallback detection** uses `looksLikeDevlogIssue()` with outdated structure patterns\n\n**Problems Identified**:\n- `buildSearchQuery()` requires specific labels that may not exist\n- `looksLikeDevlogIssue()` looks for old HTML patterns like `## Business Context`\n- With our new base64 metadata approach, these patterns won't exist\n- Always falling back means proper search isn't working\n\n**Current Detection Logic** (Outdated):\n```typescript\nhasDevlogStructure = \n  issue.body?.includes('## Business Context') ||\n  issue.body?.includes('## Technical Context')\n```\n\nThis won't work with our new metadata approach!"
