  "type": "bugfix",
  "description": "Two critical issues discovered in GitHub devlog integration: 1) List GitHub issues always falls back to \"looks-alike\" parsing instead of proper structured parsing, 2) GitHub issue parsing has field corruption where technical context gets mixed/corrupted with other fields during the parsing process.",

    "businessContext": "Users viewing GitHub devlog entries are experiencing data corruption and poor parsing quality, which undermines the reliability of the GitHub Issues integration as a devlog storage backend.",
    "technicalContext": "The GitHub mapper appears to have two distinct parsing issues: the list operation is defaulting to fallback parsing mode, and the HTML content parsing is bleeding content between fields, particularly affecting the technical context field.",
