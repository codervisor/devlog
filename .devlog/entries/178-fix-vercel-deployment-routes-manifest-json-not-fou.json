      "content": "ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The issue is a mismatch between Next.js output directory and vercel.json configuration. The web package build script uses NEXT_BUILD_MODE=standalone which triggers next.config.js to output to .next-build directory instead of .next, but vercel.json outputDirectory is still set to .next. This causes Vercel to look for routes-manifest.json in the wrong location."

      "content": "SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Updated vercel.json outputDirectory from '.next' to '.next-build' to match the actual build output when NEXT_BUILD_MODE=standalone is used. The Next.js configuration conditionally outputs to .next-build when in standalone mode, and this was confirmed by local testing. The routes-manifest.json file is correctly generated in .next-build directory.",

The build process generates all required files (routes-manifest.json, build-manifest.json, BUILD_ID, etc.) in the .next-build directory, which now matches the vercel.json outputDirectory configuration. The deployment should now succeed without the 'routes-manifest.json not found' error."
