  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Add Mermaid diagram support to the markdown renderer to enable better visualization of processes, flows, and system architectures within devlog entries. This will allow users to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and other visual representations directly in their markdown content.",

    "businessContext": "Visual diagrams significantly improve communication and understanding of complex processes, system architectures, and workflows. By integrating Mermaid, we enable users to create professional-looking diagrams without external tools, making devlogs more comprehensive and easier to understand. This will particularly benefit technical documentation, system design discussions, and process explanations.",
    "technicalContext": "Need to integrate Mermaid.js into the existing markdown rendering pipeline. This involves:\n- Adding Mermaid as a dependency to the web package\n- Extending the markdown parser to recognize Mermaid code blocks\n- Implementing client-side rendering of Mermaid diagrams\n- Ensuring proper styling and responsive behavior\n- Handling potential security considerations with diagram rendering",
