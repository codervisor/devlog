  "type": "feature",
  "description": "The current JSON storage implementation uses a centralized `index.json` file that becomes fragile when multiple AI agents work on the same repository concurrently. The index file contains all devlog metadata in a single JSON object, making it prone to merge conflicts and potential data corruption when multiple agents create or update devlog entries simultaneously.\n\n## Current Issues:\n1. **Merge Conflicts**: When multiple agents modify `index.json` simultaneously, git merge conflicts occur\n2. **Data Loss Risk**: Failed merges can corrupt the entire index, making all devlogs inaccessible\n3. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent reads/writes can lead to inconsistent state\n4. **Fragile Dependencies**: The entire system relies on a single point of failure (index.json)\n\n## Solution Approaches:\n1. **Distributed Index Pattern**: Split index into multiple smaller files (e.g., one per devlog)\n2. **Append-Only Log**: Use event sourcing with append-only operations \n3. **File-Based Discovery**: Eliminate index dependency by scanning entry files directly\n4. **Lock-Free Operations**: Design operations to be naturally mergeable",
