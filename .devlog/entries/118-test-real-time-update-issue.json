Second devlog created through MCP (ID 119) did NOT appear in web UI - real-time updates failed\n3. SSE connection shows as active with periodic reconnections\n4. Stats counter still shows 106 instead of 107, suggesting stats are not updating either\n5. Browser console shows no SSE messages for the second devlog creation\n\nHypothesis: There may be an intermittent issue with the SSE event broadcasting or the MCP adapter's event emission."

      "content": "**CONFIRMED ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Intermittent Real-time Updates**\n\nTesting Results:\n✅ Devlog 118 creation: Appeared immediately in real-time\n❌ Devlog 119 creation: Did NOT appear in real-time (required manual refresh)\n✅ Devlog 118 status update: Appeared in real-time (New → In Progress)\n✅ Stats counter: Updated correctly (106 → 107) after manual refresh\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe issue is intermittent, suggesting a race condition or connection issue between:\n1. MCP server DevlogManager instance (emits events)\n2. Web server DevlogManager instance (should receive events via shared devlogEvents)\n3. SSE bridge initialization timing (initializes only when client connects to /api/events)\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Both MCP and Web servers create separate DevlogManager instances\n- They share the same global `devlogEvents` emitter from @devlog/core\n- SSE bridge initializes on first client connection but may not persist\n- Events are emitted but not always received by active SSE connections\n\n**Solution Required:**\nEnsure SSE bridge is always active and events are reliably propagated."

The root cause was that the SSE bridge wasn't being initialized when the DevlogManager was created in the web server. Fixed by ensuring sseEventBridge.initialize() is called in getDevlogManager().",
