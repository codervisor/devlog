     - Consider using `git mv` to preserve history
   
2. **Component Rename Cascade** - Medium
   - **Impact**: Many files need updates when renaming components
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Use IDE refactoring tools (F2 in VS Code)
     - Update one component at a time
     - Keep aliases during transition
     - Comprehensive testing after each rename

3. **URL Changes Breaking Bookmarks** - Medium
   - **Impact**: Users' saved links stop working
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Keep existing URLs, add redirects for new ones
     - Add deprecation notices
     - Document migration path
     - Gradual transition over multiple releases

4. **Performance Regression During Reorganization** - Low
   - **Impact**: Slower builds or runtime after moves
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Benchmark before/after each phase
     - Monitor bundle sizes
     - Keep imports efficient (no circular dependencies)
     - Use code splitting appropriately

5. **Test Suite Breakage** - Medium
   - **Impact**: Tests fail after file moves
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Move tests with their implementation files
     - Update test imports immediately
     - Run tests frequently during work
     - Fix failures before moving to next file

## 📝 Decision Log

### October 30, 2025 - Phase 3 Complete
- **Decision**: Completed Phase 3 UI/UX reorganization in single day
- **Rationale**: UI updates straightforward, component aliases simple, build validation quick
- **Achievement**: All user-facing text uses "Work Item", component export aliases added for backward compatibility
- **Impact**: Clearer terminology for users, agent observability emphasized, zero breaking changes
- **Files**: 10 files updated with UI text, error messages, and component aliases

### October 30, 2025 - Phase 2 Complete
- **Decision**: Completed Phase 2 code reorganization in single day
- **Rationale**: Core services were already in correct locations, only MCP tools needed moving
- **Achievement**: All Phase 2 goals met - services organized by feature domain, MCP tools reorganized, full build successful
- **Impact**: Cleaner codebase structure, clear PRIMARY (agent observability) vs SECONDARY (project management) distinction
- **Commit**: 9dfe2d9 - refactor(mcp): reorganize tools into agent-observability and project-management folders

### October 30, 2025 - Phase 2 Start
- **Decision**: Start with Phase 2 (file moves) instead of more terminology changes
- **Rationale**: Phase 1 Quick Wins complete, foundation set, time to reorganize actual code
- **Impact**: Cleaner codebase structure, easier to navigate, better DX

### October 21, 2025 (Phase 1 Complete)
- **Decision**: Complete Quick Wins before major file moves
- **Rationale**: Low-risk improvements first, set foundation, validate approach
- **Impact**: Terminology clarified, folder structure created, ready for file moves

### October 21, 2025
- **Decision**: Keep "devlog" as brand name, use "work item" for entries
- **Rationale**: Brand recognition vs. clarity - compromise solution
- **Impact**: Backward compatibility maintained, gradual migration possible

### October 22, 2025 (PR #50)
- **Decision**: Implement real-time updates via SSE, not WebSockets
- **Rationale**: Simpler, unidirectional flow, easier to deploy
- **Impact**: Real-time dashboard updates working well

### October 21, 2025 (PR #48)
- **Decision**: Pivot to agent observability as primary feature
- **Rationale**: Market opportunity, unique value proposition
- **Impact**: Major UI/UX reorganization, new feature priority

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers Working on Phase 2

1. **Prepare your environment**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   pnpm test  # Ensure everything works before starting
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/phase2-code-reorganization
   ```

3. **Start with Day 1 tasks**:
   - Move `AgentEventService` to `agent-observability/events/`
   - Use `git mv` to preserve history:
     ```bash
     git mv packages/core/src/services/agent-event-service.ts \
            packages/core/src/agent-observability/events/agent-event-service.ts
     ```
   - Update imports immediately
   - Run tests: `pnpm test`

4. **Test frequently**:
   ```bash
   # After each file move
   cd packages/core
   pnpm build
   pnpm test
   
   # After Day 1-2 complete
   cd ../..
   pnpm build  # Full monorepo
   pnpm test   # All tests
   ```

5. **Commit incrementally**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "refactor(core): move AgentEventService to agent-observability folder"
   ```

6. **Submit PR at end of week**:
   - Reference this roadmap in PR description
   - Link to specific day/task completed
   - Include migration notes
   - Request review

### For Project Managers

1. **Track progress** using weekly checkpoints above
2. **Monitor blockers** - update "Blockers & Risks" section
3. **Validate acceptance criteria** before marking tasks complete
4. **Update timeline** if risks materialize or priorities change
5. **Communicate changes** to stakeholders weekly

### Testing Strategy

**During Development**:
```bash
# Quick validation after each change
pnpm build             # Just the package you're working on
pnpm test              # Unit tests

# Before committing
pnpm validate          # Lint + type check
pnpm test              # All tests

# Before PR
pnpm build             # Full monorepo
pnpm test              # All packages
docker compose up      # Integration test
```

**After PR Merge**:
- CI/CD runs full validation
- Deploy to staging environment
- Manual smoke testing
- Monitor error rates
