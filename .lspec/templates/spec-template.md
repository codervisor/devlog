## Overview

<!-- What problem are we solving? Why is this important now? -->

<!-- Example:
Brief description of the feature/fix/improvement and its value. Keep it concise - 2-3 paragraphs max.
-->

## Problem Statement / Current State

<!-- What's not working? What gaps exist? What are the pain points? -->

<!-- Example:
- ❌ Issue 1: Description
- ❌ Issue 2: Description
- ❌ Issue 3: Description

Optionally include metrics, user feedback, or concrete examples.
-->

## Objectives

<!-- What are the key goals? What success looks like? -->

1. **Objective 1** - What we'll achieve
2. **Objective 2** - What we'll achieve
3. **Objective 3** - What we'll achieve

## Design

<!-- Technical approach and architecture decisions -->

<!-- Example:
For simple specs, describe directly here.
For complex specs, reference separate design.md:
  See **[design.md](./design.md)** for complete technical design.
-->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- Phased approach or task breakdown -->

<!-- Example:
For simple specs, list tasks directly here:
  - [ ] Task 1
  - [ ] Task 2
  - [ ] Task 3

For complex specs, reference separate implementation.md:
  See **[implementation.md](./implementation.md)** for detailed task breakdown.
-->

## Success Criteria

<!-- How will we know this is done? What metrics validate success? -->

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Timeline

<!-- Optional: Estimated effort, phases, deadlines -->

**Estimated Effort**: [hours/days/weeks]

<!-- Example for phased work:
- Phase 1: Description (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Description (Week 2)
-->
